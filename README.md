Assignment Summary
This assignment focuses on exploratory data analysis and visualization using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The tasks include preparing the data, generating summary statistics, creating various types of plots, calculating quartiles and outliers, performing correlation and regression analysis, and finally, submitting the analysis.

Task Breakdown:
Prepare the Data: Merging data frames, handling duplicates, and ensuring data cleanliness.
Generate Summary Statistics: Calculating mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volume for each drug regimen.
Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts: Visualizing the distribution of data using bar charts and pie charts.
Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot: Identifying potential outliers and creating box plots to visualize the distribution of tumor volume.
Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot: Visualizing tumor volume versus time point for a single mouse and mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.
Calculate Correlation and Regression: Analyzing the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume using correlation coefficient and linear regression.

Observations:
Treatment Efficacy: The box plot analysis suggests varying efficacy among different treatments, with Capomulin and Ramicane showing potential for better outcomes.
Gender Distribution: The balanced gender distribution among the mice ensures the generalizability of the study results.
Correlation between Mouse Weight and Tumor Volume: The scatter plot and correlation analysis reveal a positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume within the Capomulin regimen.
Overall, the assignment provides valuable insights into data analysis techniques and visualization methods using Python.
